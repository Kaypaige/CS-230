1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client aiming to expand their Android-only game Draw It or Lose It into a cross-platform, web-based application. They required a scalable, multi-user system with unique identifiers for teams and games, and constraints allowing only one instance of a game in memory at a time.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I exceeded expectations particularly in the evaluation and recommendation sections by deeply researching system architectures, platforms, and tools. My thorough analysis helped identify optimal solutions aligned with the client's requirements.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The structured design document kept my development plan focused and organized, ensuring that I addressed all requirements without overcomplicating the process. It also allowed me to clarify technical decisions in advance, which streamlined both planning and implementation.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one section, I would incorporate pseudocode to better visualize key processes and logic flow. This would further enhance team communication and provide clearer development guidance.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I translated user needs into technical requirements through detailed analysis and documentation, such as using unique identifiers and ensuring cross-platform compatibility. Addressing user needs is essential to building software that not only functions correctly but also meets client expectations and prevents costly miscommunication.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

My approach relied heavily on upfront research, clear documentation, and object-oriented design principles to ensure scalability and maintainability. In the future, I would continue using structured documentation, user stories, and Agile strategies to break down complex systems into manageable, goal-driven components.
